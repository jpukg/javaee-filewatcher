# javaee-filewatcher

Java 7 introduced a directory monitoring API, [Watchservice](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/notification.html)  which is designed to be more efficient than polling. 

There are plenty of tutorials on how to use this API in a Java SE environment but I could barely find tutorials based on a Java EE environment.

This is basically a "template" project to use as reference when you use the Watchservice in a Java EE(transactional) environment, this is meant to help avoid the gotchas I came across.

## How to run the sample

Clone the repo [https://github.com/stoan/javaee-filewatcher.git]

With Maven 3 run: *mvn package*

Create directory *C:\inbox*

Deploy the javaee-filewatcher.ear in the **target** directory to a Java EE server (tested on Wildfly 10) 

Create files in the created directory above and monitor the server console
